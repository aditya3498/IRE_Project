# Project Title

Extracting and Summarizing Tweets

## Steps Used:

1. Data scraping(Dataset)
2. Named Entity and Event Phrase Recognition
3. Graph generation (using pagerank to assign scores to nodes)
4. Creating subgraphs from generated graph
5. Summarizing the tweets using the subgraphs
6. Testing Quality of summaries created

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook tweet_retrieval.ipynb
```

## Results
 Evaluation Mechanism & Resultsâ€‹: 
 For evaluating the quality of summary generated by the graph model we used Rouge-1 score. Relevant summaries for each set of tweets corresponding to a hashtag is generated manually for about 50 recent hashtags. The rouge-1 scores are then calculated by comparing with the manually generated summaries. Rouge-1 scores are used for tweet summarization as tweets often use very terse conscies languages. They are often unstructured documents with very little usable data for analysis. Also tweets often have other tags and hashtags which are good descriptive singular elements in tweets.
